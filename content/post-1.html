        In my second year, before making any decision for my second upcoming internship, I decided to throw myself out there, I went to a field
completely unknown to me. I used links in my small network to obtain an internship at Hoverlay.<br><br>
Hoverlay is a small startup based in Boston (MA), and focuses on augmented reality (AR), specifically on providing a publishing platform 
for creators, storytellers, artists, journalists, etc. Their solution provides an abstraction from the technical aspects of the 3D and 
AR space (Best compared to YouTube, as before it existed, people had to be very knowledgeable to post videos online).<br><br>
To briefly describe my experience at Hoverlay, I would distinguish 3 parts. First, I had to familiarize myself with the AR tool, 
and 3D modeling without having any prior knowledge. Second, we (Nicolas: my supervisor and I) were invited and joined many many events, 
meeting tons of amazing people (MIT Reality Hack, Northeastern Augmented Event, Boston Art expos). There,my job was to find potential clients, 
talk to anyone who would be interested in   using Hoverlay, integrating Hoverlay into their courses,  into their marketing, or just in their 
personal projects. On the 'marketing' aspect of my internship, I was involved in writing press articles and blog posts to
promote past partnerships. Last but not least, I worked on the support aspect, receiving messages, providing help, fixing or reporting bugs.
