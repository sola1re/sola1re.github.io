# Man-Dex

## About the Man-Dex 👾
The Man-Dex is the Mandon Index, an extension of my own brain to keep track of the things I do, helping me reflect on past projects and achievements, and hopefully aiding others in the process.

You can learn more about me just by visiting [sola1re.github.io](https://sola1re.github.io)

Made from scratch, no external libraries, no frameworks, and definitely no WordPress! 😡 Take a look at the source code 😎

## Background 🏗️
I'm Paul, the man from the Man-Dex. Man-Made. I am currently a student at [EFREI Paris](https://www.efrei.fr/).
